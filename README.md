<br><strong>NAME:</strong> Franco Sebastian C. Magno
<br><strong>COURSE & YEAR:</strong> BSIT-3
<br>
<p>My hobbies include playing and producing music. Academically, I am dedicated in being an I.T Specialist because I like the environment and decent pay. I was only introduced to programming when I enrolled for the program BSIT. I am the 3rd sibling of my family of 5. I am in a band called Gleam, which consists of 4 members: Harvey, Franco, Fynn, and Jayjay. I'm usually kind towards people and get comfortable easily. :)</p>
